Portable Vulnerability Assessment System for Wireless as Data Transition Anomaly in IoT

                                                  ABSTRACT
It is simple to take advantage of computer technologies such as WiFi, IoT, and Bluetooth. As a result, as a data
transition anomaly in IoT, we want to create a portable vulnerability assessment system for wireless.It uses the
Raspberry Pi 4, Bash Scripting, and Comprehensive Linux Os for automating existing manual technologies
like laptops and Desktops. Users are achieving the requirements by enhancing day-to-day networks audit and
vulnerability scanning easier.
It might result in a smoother user interface and a faster procedure with the aid of excellent configuration on a
little device. It can help persons who work in cyber security. Rather of lugging a machine, it may be utilised to
focus on their core tasks such as shell scripting, tool use, and so on. When compared to the manual command
method through terminal, it will increase the time necessary to audit a network.Businesses may use it to detect
weaknesses and vulnerabilities in their wireless networks.
The objective of this project is network discovery, WPA/WPA2 security code cracking, wi - fi intrusions like
deauthentication / disassociation attack, mdk4 attack vectors, Deauthentication aireplay threats, as well as
other obsolete and yet successful attacks like - Beacon packet flood attacks, Authentication Denial of Service
attacks. Researchers may develop a Hardware-based Technology Cycle-based Hardware Testing like
Information Transitions Abnormality on IoT to examine network and weaknesses like Poor Passwords, Less
Writing Encryption like WPS, and WEP. To conduct out whatever assaults or eavesdrop on connected Pc or
Mobile devices, researchers have to build tiny, lightweight, and transportable Computers with these
autonomous features.
One of the key features researchers can add to start making the device quite developed and fascinating to use
is the integration of devices to Mobile devices or Personal computers windows os via software like juice ssh
and vnc technology to interconnect over the devices with the android mobile application for something like
the ui of the deployed os on devices.
